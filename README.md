# ResultsDeclareScript
VTU semester result declaration script

Compatible on Macintosh machines ï£¿

Simply enter your VTU USN and check if the results for your roll # has been declared or not.
The script checks for VTU's response every 30 seconds, indefinately, until forcefully stopped. Due to heavy site traffic during results announcement, the script might return multiple instances of failed responses indicating congestion. You could add a threshold value for suitably handling those responses.
